        <h2>2.3	Charges and Fees</h2>
        <p>
            The Student Health Center accepts cash, checks, and all major credit cards.  Clients that are unable to make payment the day or service are required to sign a Fee of Service Agreement and make payment arrangements.

Students are responsible for payment of any services obtained outside of the Student Health Services, including diagnostic tests, consultations, outpatient office visits, emergency room treatment and hospitalization.  We encourage students with private insurance to review their policies to make sure that they have an acceptable level of coverage for those services.  Students are responsible for asking the Student Health Services to contact their provider or carrier if their insurance plans require prior authorization for diagnostic tests or services.
