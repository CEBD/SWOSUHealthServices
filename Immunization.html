Hepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of an infected person. Vaccination for Hepatitis B requires three separate shots given over a four to six-month period.

If you are enrolling at SWOSU for the first time and plan to live on campus you will be required to provide written documentation to Health Services of vaccination against meningococcal disease. Vaccinations may be obtained from Health Services, your health care provider or the health department. Students who are under age 18 may obtain meningococcal vaccinations from the health department at no cost. Recommended by ACHA, CDC, & AAP, Meningococcal disease is a serious illness, caused by bacteria. Meningitis is an infection of the brain and spinal cord coverings. Meningococcal disease can also cause blood infections. About 2,600 people get meningococcal disease each year in the U.S. In spite of treatment with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who live, another 10% lose their arms or legs, become deaf, have problems with their nervous systems, become mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. College freshmen, particularly those who live in residence halls, have an increase risk of getting meningococcal disease. Meningococcal vaccination can prevent 2 of 3 important types of meningococcal disease in older children and adults. Vaccination against meningococcal disease consists of 1 injection.
